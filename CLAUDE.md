# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **data and research repository** for an innovation challenge (hackathon) focused on Community Health Worker (CHW) solutions in Kenya. It is a collaboration with Aga Khan University (AKU) centered on the "Afya Totto" community health initiative.

**This is not a code repository.** It contains source materials, interviews, and assets for hackathon participants to reference when building their solutions.

## Key Context for Solutions

Based on the judging rubric, solutions should prioritize:

- **Human-centered design** for CHWs and caregivers in field settings
- **Frugal engineering**: offline-first, low data usage, battery-efficient, low-cost devices
- **Speed**: workflows completable within 3 minutes
- **Technical feasibility** for low-resource Android devices
- **Cultural sensitivity** appropriate for Kenyan community health contexts

## Working with Materials

- Audio interviews contain firsthand accounts from CHVs, CHEWs, pastors, data managers, and MOH officials
- Transcription files (.docx) are available for some interviews
- Survey assets include official MOH household registers and CHV log books
- Community photos document real field conditions and community engagement
