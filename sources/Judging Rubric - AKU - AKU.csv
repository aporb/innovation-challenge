Criteria,Weight,1 (Poor),2 (Fair),3 (Good),4 (Very Good),5 (Excellent)
Problem Understanding & Human-Centered Design,15%,Little to no understanding of CHWs or caregivers. Workflow is unrealistic or inappropriate for field settings.,"Basic understanding of users, but important constraints or realities are overlooked.",Demonstrates a reasonable understanding of end users workflows and caregiver needs.,Strong empathy for end users. Design choices clearly reflect field realities.,"Exceptional human-centered design. Deep empathy, cultural sensitivity, and realistic field workflows throughout."
Design (UI/UX),10%,No design and/or the design is messy and hard to navigate.,The UI/UX is confusing or poorly executed.,"The design is clean and shows a logical, usable flow.","The design is intuitive, visually appealing, and enhances the user experience.","The UI/UX is outstanding, showing attention to detail ready for consumer use."
Technical Execution,25%,Minimal to no working code demonstrated. Only static mockups or a completely non-functional shell.,Very simple features implemented. Demonstrates a basic understanding but relies on simple APIs or logic.,Main features of the demo are functional and stable. Uses common frameworks or a single external API correctly.,"Implements multiple, complex features. Shows evidence of difficult integration, novel libraries, or back-end logic (e.g., machine learning model used).",Highly complex technical achievement. All core features work reliably with advanced data processing or novel technical architecture.
Usability & Speed,10%,"Workflow is slow, confusing, or impractical in real-world use.","Usable with effort, but contains unnecessary steps or friction.",Logical flow that could realistically be completed within a short visit.,Very intuitive flow designed for quick use with minimal taps or typing.,"Exceptionally fast, intuitive workflow that clearly supports completion within 3 minutes."
Technical Feasibility & Frugality,15%,"Ignores device, data, battery, cost or storage constraints. Unrealistic technical assumptions.","Partially feasible but relies on optimistic assumptions about connectivity, device performance, data usage, budget or battery life.",Technically feasible with reasonable choices for low-budget and low-resource environments.,"Thoughtful, efficient technical design that accounts for low cost, device limits, offline use, minimal data storage, and battery efficiency.","Outstanding frugal engineering. Low-cost model. Lightweight, secure, offline-first, battery-efficient, and well-suited for real-world CHW deployment on low-resource Android devices."
Innovation & Creativity,15%,"The idea is unclear, generic, or a minor iteration on existing popular applications. Lacks any creative twist.",Solves a common problem in a predictable way. Lacks novelty but shows a small improvement on a standard solution.,"The idea is somewhat unique, or it applies existing technology to a new, unexpected domain in a smart way.",The project presents a genuinely original and clever solution to the identified problem; the approach is fresh and insightful.,The idea is entirely novel and represents a major paradigm shift or new way of thinking about the problem space.
Presentation,10%,"The pitch is poorly structured and the goal of the project is unclear.

Problem is unclear or incorrectly defined, the solution is poorly explained, and the impact is missing or not understood.","The presentation covers the basics but lacks clarity or enthusiasm. 

Problem is somewhat identified and the solution is partially explained, but the impact is vague, weakly defined, or not clearly connected to the problem.","The pitch is organized and easy to follow. 

Problem and solution are generally clear, and impact is mentioned, but the explanation lacks depth, clarity, or strong connection between the solution and its outcomes.","The presentation is dynamic and persuasive. 

Problem is clearly identified and the solution is well explained, with a good understanding of the expected impact, though some aspects could be more fully articulated or supported.","Pitch is flawless, hitting all key points with high enthusiasm and professionalism. 

Problem is clearly identified, solution is explained, and the team has a strong grasp of the impact of their solution. "
